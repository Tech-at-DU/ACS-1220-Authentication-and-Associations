# Homework 5: Testing

## Purpose (Why should I do this?)

This project will allow you to practice writing route tests for an existing project using the `unittest` library. After this assignment, you should be able to add unit tests to your own Flask projects.

Scoring for this project is as follows:

| Score | Rating | Correctness | Code Quality |
| :---: | :----: | :---------: | :----------: |
| **1** | **Needs Improvement** | Less than two of the form routes are completed, or form routes are not functional. | Code is messy and hard to follow. Code includes TODOs or does not include docstrings for most routes. |
| **2** | **Basic** | Route tests partially test the intended functionality. All tests pass. | Some routes have code that is messy and hard to follow. Some routes do not include docstrings. |
| **3** | **Proficient** | (Almost) all tests pass and test the desired functionality. Minor errors or test failures may be present. | Code is clear and easy to follow. Submitted code does not include TODOs. Nearly all functions have docstrings. |
| **4** | **Advanced** | All tests pass and test the desired functionality. Stretch challenges are complete and demonstrate an advanced understanding of the concepts presented. | Code is extensible and may utilize helper functions, classes, or advanced data structures to aid in readability. |

## Setup

Clone the [starter code](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-1220-Testing-Homework/tree/main) and follow the instructions in the README to get started on this project.

Before starting this project, make sure to run the code to familiarize yourself with how it works.

## Instructions

Now that our Books app is totally done, it's your turn to write tests to ensure that nothing will break when we push it to our customers.

Navigate to `books_app/main/tests.py` and `books_app/auth/tests.py` and fill in all missing test method definitions in order to fully test the functionality of the application.

**Stretch Challenge**: Come up with some more edge case tests and add them in.
